# Railway Curve Calculator

A web application built with Next.js to calculate railway curve parameters based on user inputs (maximum speed and radius). Users can fine-tune additional parameters, view detailed results, and export them as a beautifully formatted PDF. This project leverages Tailwind CSS v4, ShadCN UI, and Framer Motion for a modern, animated UI, with Next.js providing a reliable setup for development and deployment.

## Features
- **Simple Input**: Enter `Maximum Speed (kmph)` and `Radius of Curve (m)` to get started.
- **Default Values**: Pre-filled defaults for Cant Deficiency (75mm), Goods Train Speed (65kmph), etc., with optional fine-tuning.
- **Comprehensive Calculations**: Computes Equilibrium Cant, Actual Cant, Max Permissible Speed, Transition Length, and more, based on railway engineering formulas.
- **Animated UI**: Smooth result animations using Framer Motion.
- **PDF Export**: Download results as a formatted PDF using react-to-print.
- **Responsive Design**: Built with Tailwind CSS v4 for a mobile-friendly experience.
- **Reliable Setup**: Next.js ensures a robust development and deployment experience.
